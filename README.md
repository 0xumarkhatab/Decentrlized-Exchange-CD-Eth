# Decentrlized-Exchange-Uniswap-Eth-CD-Pair

This is a Dex that exhibits the Good understanding of 
  
  - Blockchain Fundamentals 
  - Advanced solidity topics 
  - Decentralized Exchanges.

This is a  Decentralized platform where any CryptoDev NFT Holder ( hold through my previous DAPP- Initial Coin Offering )
can 

  - Add liquidity to the Dex
  - Claim Liquidity tokens with ether as reward
  - Swap Ethereum Balance with CryptoDev Tokens
  


### Precation
    
    Don't use your Mainnet Wallet Account
    Use Goerli Test Network
    Make sure to mint some NFTs from my Market place Dapp before continuing
